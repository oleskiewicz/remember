remember
========
simple memoization for deterministic, repeatable shell processes

let's say there is a long-running process which you need to cache for later usage, i.e.
converting a photo to black and white version.  You can invoke

	$ < photo.jpg remember ./process.sh - - > processed.jpg

and processed.jpg will get saved in a memoized directory under the following name

    $REMEMBER_DIR/md5sum(string "./process.sh - -")-md5sum(contents of photo.jpg)

where $REMEMBER_DIR can be set in a shell, and defaults to $XDG_CACHE_HOME/remember


forget
======
to periodically clean the cache directory, you can run:

    $ forget

this will check files in $REMEMBER_DIR and delete them according to the age of the file,
rescaled such that bigger files "age" faster:

    maxd |\
         | \
         |  \
         |   \
         |    \
         |     \
         |      ..
         |        \
        -|- - - - - . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
         |           ..
         |             \
         |              ..
         |                ...
         |                   ..
         |                     ...
         |                        ....
         |                            ......
    mind |                                  ...................
         0                                              maxsize
